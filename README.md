# ANDELA SOCIALS

Andela Social was born out of the desire to keep Andelans very sociable within the organization.
It is a platform for events aggregation, to get Andelans from different departments to mingle and have fun together over a cup of coffee, a game of soccer, at a swimming pool or at a friends dinner party.
It is a platform to get events organized within the fellowship properly tracked and managed for all to see and for all to relate with irrespective of their centers.
These will improve socialization between Andelans inside and outside the company.
