# ANDELA SOCIALS

Andela Social was born out of the desire to keep Andelans very sociable within the organization.
It is a platform for events aggregation, to get Andelans from different departments to mingle and have fun together over a cup of coffee, a game of soccer, at a swimming pool or at a friends dinner party.
It is a platform to get events organized within the fellowship properly tracked and managed for all to see and for all to relate with irrespective of their centers.
These will improve socialization between Andelans inside and outside the company.


### INSTALLATION
Clone from git using
```
git@github.com:AndelaOSP/Andela-Socials.git
```

Create a `.env` file with the content of the `.env.sample` and edit with your personal details.

Check that the node version you are running is version 8. Otherwise you can use nvm to help manage the node version you are running.
Follow this [guide](https://gist.github.com/d2s/372b5943bce17b964a79#install-nvm-for-managing-nodejs-versions) to help install nvm.
You would then run `nvm install v8.0` to install node version 8 and `nvm use v8` to use that specific node version, but this will only work with that running bash session. To make version 8 the default node version for your system you would use `nvm alias default 8.0` 

Navigate into the root directory of the project and run the script `setup.sh` with the command:
```
./setup.sh
```

This scripts automatically sets up the project automatically and starts the application once that is done.

### STARTING THE APP
Subsequently, if you need to start the application after the initial setup has completed you can run the command:
```
./start.sh
```

### DB CREATION

    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_NAME=a_socials
